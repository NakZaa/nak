I'm using this post to test out how things look with Markdown syntax. Over time,
I'll be posting more about my pet projects, thoughts, and maybe even some fun
personal stories.

## What’s This About?

This blog will serve as a way for me to share my experiences, projects, and
random thoughts with the world. For now, I’m testing the waters and making sure
everything looks good. Stay tuned for more meaningful content soon..

## Testing Markdown Features

Here’s some common Markdown features:

### Headers

- Use `#` for H1 headers
- Use `##` for H2 headers
- Use `###` for H3 headers

### Lists

- Unordered lists with `-` or `*`
- Ordered lists with numbers

1. First item
2. Second item

### Code Snippets

```javascript
export default function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
}
```
